        <p style="text-indent: 2.5em;"> The <b> electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or vape</b>is a device that simulates tobacco smoking. It consists of an atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank filled with liquid. Instead of 
            <a style="color:blue;" href=# title=" Tobacco smoke is a sooty aerosol produced by the incomplete combustion of
tobacco during the smoking of cigarettes and other tobacco products ">smoke  </a>, the user inhales vapor. As such, using an e-cigarette is often called "vaping". The atomizer is a heating element that vaporizes a liquid solution called e-liquid, which quickly cools into an aerosol of tiny droplets, vapor and air. E-cigarettes are activated by taking a puff or pressing a button. Some look like traditional cigarettes, and most kinds are reusable. The vapor mainly comprises propylene glycol and/or

viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic.  "> glycerin </a>, usually with nicotine and flavoring. Its exact composition varies, and depends on several things including user behavior.

            <p style="text-align: left;">Nicotine is highly addictive. Users become physically and psychologically dependent. Scientists do not know how harmful e-cigarettes are over the long-term because it is hard to separate the effects of vaping from the effects of smoking when so many people both vape and smoke. E-cigarettes have not been used widely enough or for long enough to be sure.

                For people trying to quit smoking, e-cigarette use alongside prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) leads to a higher quit rate. For those trying to quit smoking without medical help, it is not clear whether e-cigarettes raise quit rates because the evidence is of poor quality.Vaping is likely far less harmful than smoking, but still harmful. E-cigarette vapor contains fewer toxins than cigarette smoke. It contains traces of harmful substances not found in cigarette smoke.

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <hr>
            E-cigarettes have evolved over time, and the different designs are classified in generations. First-generation e-cigarettes tend to look like traditional cigarettes and are called "cigalikes". Second-generation devices are larger and look less like traditional cigarettes. Third-generation devices include mechanical mods and variable

odorless,viscous liquid that is sweet-tasting and non-toxic.  ">voltage</a>  devices. The fourth-generation includes sub-ohm tanks (meaning they have electrical resistance of less than 1 ohm) and temperature control. There are also pod mod devices that use protonated nicotine, rather than free-base nicotine found in earlier generations, providing higher nicotine yields.            <br><br>
            <h2>E-liquid</h2><hr>
            <img src="E3.jpg" id="image1" onclick="changeimg();" width="280px" height="220px" style="float: right;">
            <p style="text-align: left;">The mixture used in vapor products such as e-cigarettes is called e-liquid. E-liquid formulations vary widely. A typical e-liquid is composed of propylene glycol and glycerin (95%) and a combination of flavorings, nicotine, and other additives (5%). The flavorings may be natural, artificial, or organic. Over 80 harmful chemicals such as formaldehyde and metallic nanoparticles have been found in e-liquids at trace quantities. There are many e-liquid manufacturers, and more than 15,000 flavors.
                <br><br><br>
                Most countries regulate what e-liquids can contain. In the US, there are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compulsory manufacturing standards and American E-liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA) recommended manufacturing standards. European Union standards are published in the EU Tobacco Products Directive.

            <h3>Popularity</h3><hr><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Since entering the market around 2003, e-cigarette use has risen rapidly. In 2011 there were about 7 million adult e-cigarette users globally, increasing to 68 million in 2020 compared with 1.1 billion cigarette smokers. There was a further rise to 82 million e-cigarette users in 2021. This increase has been attributed to targeted marketing, lower cost compared to conventional cigarettes, and the better safety profile of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco. E-cigarette use is highest in China, the US, and Europe, with China having the most users.
